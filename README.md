# CS2852

The topics of arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, sets, and hash tables are introduced. Fundamentals of algorithm performance are also introduced, with an emphasis placed on time complexity analysis. Laboratory activities include implementation of data structures as well as the application of data structures from standard libraries. 

Course Learning Outcomes:
- Student understands and applys complex data structures and algorithms
- Ability to use appropriate algorithms (and associated data structures) to solve problems
- Student has a thorough understanding of commonly used library data structures
- They can analyze the time complexity of algorithms
- Understanding of the use of recursion in problem solving
- Use data structures in software design and implementation
- Apply standard library data structures in software design
- Select appropriate data structures for a given application
